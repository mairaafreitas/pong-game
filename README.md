Pong is one of the first computer games that was ever created. The goal is to defeat your opponent by getting a point once the opponent misses a ball. This game can be played with two human players.

The left paddle moves by pressing the "w" and "s" keys and the right paddle moves by pressing "up" and "down" keys.
